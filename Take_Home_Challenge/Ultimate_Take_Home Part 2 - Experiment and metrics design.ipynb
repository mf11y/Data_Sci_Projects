    "The goal of the program is to improve driver availability. The more drivers you have spread out in a certain area, the less amount of time riders will need to wait for a driver to pick them up because there is a higher probability that there would be a driver close by. To see if the program would work, scenarios need to be identified that would cause a driver to cross the bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenarios where a driver would need to cross the bridge would be:\n",
    "1. A passenger to pick up is across the bridge\n",
    "2. The destination of a passenger they have picked up is across the bridge\n",
    "3. The driver needs to cross the bridge to place themselves in a busier area\n",
    "4. The driver needs to get home\n",
    "\n",
    "On apps like Uber, the driver can only see the passenger's destination once they've been picked up. The proposed program would not have an affect on this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two scenarios that would reduce rider waiting time would be when a driver needs to cross the bridge to pick up a passenger and when a driver would like to place himself in a busier area. Apps like Uber send requests to drivers that are close by. There could be a scenario where a driver across the bridge is closer than any other driver that is not across the bridge. There could also be times where a certain area is unusally busy or unusually quiet. A driver would need to move to a busier area to continue making profits or to make greater profits. The more drivers in a busy area, the less time riders need to wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key metric that I would use to assess program success is rider waiting time. Waiting time is the amount of time it takes for a rider to be picked up once the rider sends a pick up request. If this time is lower, then that would mean there are more drivers that are available. \n"
